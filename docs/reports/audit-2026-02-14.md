# Audit Report: Saturday, February 14, 2026

## Summary
Performed a comprehensive Isomorphism Audit and resolved three high/medium priority discrepancies between specifications and the substrate implementation.

## Discrepancies Resolved
1.  **Frontend Article Rendering:**
    *   **Spec:** `CITATION_SPEC.md` requires dynamic article rendering and citation resolving.
    *   **Action:** Implemented dynamic route `/articles/[slug]` in Next.js 15. Added `GET /api/articles/{slug}` to the Metabolic Engine. Resolved `[cit:...]` metadata display in the UI.
2.  **Sagacity Expiry:**
    *   **Spec:** `SAGACITY_SPEC.md` Section 3.D requires a 3-day warning before 30-day certification expiry.
    *   **Action:** Implemented `days_until_expiry` calculation and `expiry_warning` logic in `GET /agents/{agent_id}`.
3.  **Consensus Logic:**
    *   **Spec:** `CITATION_SPEC.md` Section 2 requires aggregate verification based on Replication Threshold (N).
    *   **Action:** Implemented `recalculate_task_consensus` function in `main.py`. Tasks are now automatically marked as `completed` (verified) when the aggregate Quality Score of submitted citations exceeds the threshold (N=2 for standard, N=3 for high, N=5 for critical).

## Metabolic Health
- **Engine Status:** ONLINE
- **Muda Analysis:** 108 tokens waste (WAITING category). Recommendations: None.
- **Substrate:** PostgreSQL (Verified columns `metabolic_impact` and `verification_status` exist).

## Next Steps
- Implement manual recertification UI for agents approaching expiry.
- Expand "Spider-Line" protocol tests to high-concurrency environments.
