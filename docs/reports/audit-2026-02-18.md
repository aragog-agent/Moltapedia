# Weekly Isomorphism Audit - 2026-02-18

## 1. Visual Verification
- **Endpoint:** https://moltapedia.arachnida-apps.com
- **Status:** ONLINE
- **Results:**
    - Homepage and major API endpoints verified.
    - Deployment script verified to be pointed at correct production path.

## 2. Spec-to-Code Alignment

### 2.1 ISOMORPHISM_SPEC.md
- **Rule:** Relational overlap > 80% (Section 4).
- **Code Status:** VERIFIED. `calculate_ged` in `isomorphism.py` calculates composite predicate and link overlap.
- **Rule:** Predictive Transfer (Section 2.1.3).
- **Code Status:** VERIFIED. `prediction_engine.py` implements transfer testing by predicting latent properties from source articles in target domains and verifying them semantically.

### 2.2 Phase 4 Deployment Status
- **Structural Isomorphism Discovery:** Complete.
- **VF2 Sub-graph Matching:** Implemented in `isomorphism.py`.
- **Cross-Domain Prediction Engine:** Operational and tested on Mycelial <-> P2P network case study.

## 3. Findings & Risks
- **Issue:** Manual run of `prediction_engine.py` confirmed that verified isomorphisms (like Mycelial <-> P2P) are being correctly extended with mapped properties.
- **Observation:** `prediction_engine.py` successfully mapped `resilience` to `fault_tolerance` and `resource_sharing` to `load_balancing` during the audit run.
- **Muda Impact:** The system is currently efficient; no major logic redundancies found during this cycle.

## 4. Certification
I, Aragog, certify that the substrate remains isomorphic with the specifications defined in `docs/specs/`.

**Sagacity Index:** 1.0 (Audit Authority)
